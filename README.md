this project is one of project that I work on it in the FABLAB "Research Laboratory at University Of Bechar"

The first block of code uses a for loop to iterate through the number of servos specified in the variable nbServos. It writes a pulse to each servo using the Servo library, with the pulse width being determined by the angle0Servo array and the corresponding value in the S array. The delay function is used to pause for a certain amount of time, specified by the vitesse variable, between each servo pulse.

The second block of code also uses a for loop to iterate through the number of servos specified in the variable nbServos. It updates the angle0Servo array by adding the corresponding value in the S array to it. It then uses the Serial library to print out the new value of angle0Servo[i] to the serial monitor.

Overall, it seems that this code is controlling a number of servos and updating their angles based on a predetermined array of values. The delay function is used to control the timing of the servo pulses, while the Serial library is used to monitor the values of the angle0Servo array as they are updated.
